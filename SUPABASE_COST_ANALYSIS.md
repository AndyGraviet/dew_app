## Estimated Daily Usage Per Active User

### Typical User Session (Average):
- Login: 1 call
- Load todo lists: 1 call
- Load tasks (3 lists avg): 3 calls
- Create/update tasks: 5 calls
- Complete tasks: 6 calls (3 tasks × 2 calls)
- Timer sessions: 8 calls (2 sessions × 4 operations)
- Misc operations: 5 calls

**Total per active user per day: ~30 API calls**

### Data Storage Per User:
- User record: ~1 KB
- Todo lists (5 avg): ~5 KB
- Tasks (50 avg): ~50 KB
- Timer sessions (30/month): ~30 KB
- Total per user: ~86 KB

## Cost Analysis for 50,000 Users

### Assumptions:
- 20% daily active users (DAU): 10,000 users
- 60% monthly active users (MAU): 30,000 users
- Average session: 30 API calls

### Free Tier Analysis:

| Resource | Free Tier Limit | Your Usage | Status |
|----------|----------------|------------|---------|
| MAUs | 50,000 | 30,000 | ✅ Within limit |
| Database Size | 500 MB | ~4.3 GB | ❌ Exceeds by 3.8 GB |
| Storage | 1 GB | ~500 MB | ✅ Within limit |
| Bandwidth | 5 GB/month | ~9 GB/month | ❌ Exceeds by 4 GB |
| API Requests | Unlimited | ~9M/month | ✅ No limit |
| Edge Functions | 500K/month | Not used | ✅ Within limit |

### Required Paid Plan: Team Tier ($25/month)

## Pro/Team Tier ($25/month) Analysis:

### Included Resources:
- Database: 8 GB included
- Storage: 100 GB included
- Bandwidth: 250 GB included
- MAUs: Unlimited
- $10/month compute credits included

### Your Usage vs Team Tier:

| Resource | Team Tier | Your Usage | Cost |
|----------|-----------|------------|------|
| Database | 8 GB | 4.3 GB | ✅ Included |
| Storage | 100 GB | 0.5 GB | ✅ Included |
| Bandwidth | 250 GB | 9 GB | ✅ Included |
| Compute | Micro instance | Sufficient | ✅ Included |

**Total Monthly Cost: $25**

## Scaling Considerations:

### At 100,000 users:
- Database: ~8.6 GB (slightly over, +$0.18/month)
- Bandwidth: ~18 GB/month (well within 250 GB)
- **Total: ~$25.18/month**

### At 500,000 users:
- Database: ~43 GB (+35 GB × $0.125 = $4.38)
- Bandwidth: ~90 GB/month (within 250 GB)
- Compute: May need Small instance (+$25/month)
- **Total: ~$54.38/month**

## Optimization Recommendations:

1. **Batch API Calls**: 
   - Combine task reordering into single batch update
   - Fetch multiple lists' tasks in one query

2. **Implement Caching**:
   - Cache todo lists (change infrequently)
   - Cache completed tasks

3. **Use Realtime Selectively**:
   - Only for active list/task updates
   - Not for historical data

4. **Data Retention Policy**:
   - Archive old timer sessions (>6 months)
   - Soft delete old completed tasks

5. **Database Optimization**:
   - Add indexes on frequently queried fields
   - Use database views for complex queries

## Conclusion:

For 50,000 users with your current usage patterns:
- **Free Tier**: ❌ Not sufficient (database size exceeds limit)
- **Team Tier ($25/month)**: ✅ Perfect fit with room to grow
- **Break-even**: At ~2 paid users ($12.50 each) you cover costs

The Team tier provides excellent headroom for growth up to ~100,000 users before needing any usage-based additions. The platform is very cost-effective for a productivity app of this scale.
